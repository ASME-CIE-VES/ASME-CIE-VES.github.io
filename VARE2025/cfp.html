            <h2>General Info:</h2>
            <p><br/>In VAR-E 2025, we consider the scope of immersive environments to be broad and invite innovative and fundamental research across a wide spectrum of virtual environments. Specifically, any type of environment in the reality-virtuality spectrum is a virtual environment and any system that embodies the interplay across humans, computing devices, interaction technologies, and feedback mechanisms is a virtual system.</p>
            <p>We invite you to submit your research at VARE 2025 in the form of:<br/>
            •	A Technical Paper that is a full-length, peer-reviewed paper that is accepted for presentation at a technical session and publication in the conference proceedings. It requires a draft paper upon submittal for consideration; if accepted, a final paper is required. Templates and guidelines can be found <a href="https://idetc.secure-platform.com/a/page/Help/author_resources">here</a>. A research paper, if accepted, will be published in the proceeding of the conference (indexed by Scopus). Selected papers will be considered for extension as a <strong>journal publication</strong> to be submitted for consideration in <strong>The ASME Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering (JCISE)</strong>. Moreover, one of the paper submitted to VARE will be awarded with the <strong>"VAR-E Best Paper Award"</strong>.<br/>
            •	A Technical Presentation that is a non-publication presentation that is accepted and scheduled for presentation at a technical session but is not published in the conference proceedings. It only requires an abstract upon submittal for consideration. This is an excellent way to <strong>disseminate project results, already published research, etc...</strong>
          </p>
          <p>We remind you that one fee covers up to two presentation slots at the conference, which can include two technical papers, two technical presentations, or a mix of the two.

          </p>
            
          
          <h2>Topics</h2>
          
            <h3>GENERAL TOPICS ON VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY</h3>
            <p>
              This session explores the broad landscape of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), focusing on their technologies, applications, and future trends. Attendees will delve into the core concepts and development frameworks driving immersive experiences across these platforms. Discussions will cover the advancements in hardware, software, and user interfaces, as well as the role of VR and AR in industry and the latest advancement related to web-based technologies (WebXR) and Remote Rendering. This comprehensive overview is designed to equip professionals, developers, and enthusiasts with the knowledge and tools to understand the current state and potential of VR, AR, and MR technologies. Theoretical studies, position papers and case studies are welcome.
              </p>

            <h3>USER EXPERIENCE (UX) AND HUMAN-MACHINE INTERACTION</h3>
			<p>User Experience (UX) and Human-Machine Interaction have been extensively studied to establish effective interaction and communication between extended reality systems and human users, with the goal of fostering trust and enhancing both actual and perceived safety, efficiency, comfort, and prosocial behavior. The design of user experiences in virtual environments is inherently predicated upon a fundamental understanding of human perception, cognition, behavior, and action. Systematic new and existing user interactions, spatial technologies (cameras, controllers, haptics devices), visual representations of geometric and contextual information, and user preferences (such as gesture elicitation, micro-gestures) is critical in order to gain insights for virtual environment design. This symposium seeks contributions that aim to enrich user experience in virtual environments through the development and evaluation of (a) new ways to interact with virtual objects, (b) new ways of interaction with other people in virtual spaces, (c) new ways to represent visual as well as non-visual information in virtual environments, and (d) new insights on how users behave and perform in virtual environments. Research efforts on defining, measuring, and understanding user experience in cyber-physical environments are also of interest. Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):<br/>
			•	Collaborative and multi-user virtual environments<br/>
			•	Integration of multi-touch and spatial user interfaces<br/>
			•	Mobile interactions and wearable technologies<br/>
      •	Large language models (LLMs) in XR Experiences<br/>
			•	Speech-based interactions<br/>
			•	Visualization of geometric data and non-geometric data evaluation metrics of user actions and performance<br/>
			•	Haptics- and gaze-based interactions in VR/AR/MR<br/>
			•	Utilizing physiological sensors (EEG, ECG, etc.) in virtual environments<br/>
      •	User experience and usability<br/>
      •	User comfort and trust in human-machine interface
			</p>
			
			<h3>XR APPLICATIONS</h3>
			<p>User interfaces, interactions, and experiences are now pervasive in design, manufacturing, product inspection, customization, healthcare, education, technical training, and even daily consumer activities such as online purchases. The levels of user immersion possible within the reality-virtuality continuum affect how designers design, engineers produce, and users use products. It has applications in healthcare, from preoperative planning to surgical procedures support, to post operative care including pain management, physical therapy, and exposure therapy. It can also enhance education and training experiences. This is due to the unique affordances offered by the flexibility and intuitiveness of interaction with virtual objects and environments, the immersive experience and context-aware information visualization, perceptions about spatiality and dimensionality, and multi-modal (visual, auditory, and tangible) feedback. This symposium invites innovative research that incorporates technologies around virtual environments within concrete application contexts relevant to the domains of engineering and healthcare. Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):<br/>
        •	Healthcare applications in VE <br/>
        •	Designing VE for accessibility, disability, and wellbeing <br/>
        •	Speech-driven interfaces for design & manufacturing <br/>
        •	Virtual environments for decision making support<br/>
        •	Spatial reasoning, object recognition, and 3D tracking<br/>
        •	Human-machine/robot collaboration<br/>
        •	AR/VR-assisted assembly, disassembly, diagnosis, and equipment maintenance<br/>
        •	AR/VR and digital twins <br/>
        •	Multi-user and distributed AR/VR systems in collaborative spaces<br/>
        •	Cyber physical system and Industry IoT with AR/VR<br/>
        •	Competence, performance, and usability assessment of AR/VR systems <br/>
        •	Ergonomic analysis of AR/VR systems<br/>
        •	WebXR applications<br/>
        •	Virtual Classroom<br/>
        •	Immersive Training<br/>
        •	XR for Education
			</p>
			
			<h3>VR/AR Hardware, Accessibility, and Human Factors</h3>
			<p>Advancements in VR/AR hardware, such as headsets, haptic devices, and tracking systems, are ongoing research areas. Improving the quality, affordability, and comfort of these devices is a primary concern. In addition, ensuring that VR/AR experiences are accessible to individuals with disabilities is an important research area. This includes developing adaptive technologies and inclusive design practices. This symposium aims to explore the intersection of cutting-edge hardware developments and inclusive design principles to make VR/AR experiences accessible to a diverse range of users. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
        •	Advancements in VR/AR Hardware<br/>
        •	Inclusive Design and User-Centered Approaches <br/>
        •	Haptic Feedback and Sensory Interfaces<br/>
        •	Case Studies and Real-World Applications<br/>
        •	Ethical Considerations and Data Privacy
