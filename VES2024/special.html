            <h6>VES Show-And-Tell</h6>
			<p>Research in virtual environments and systems often leads to the development of innovative software, hardware, and complete working systems. The VES Show-and-Tell event invites academic and industry researchers to submit proposals for live demonstrations of hardware and software systems developed to advance the design of virtual environments. Presenters are expected to showcase the progression and development of all forms of CIE-related software/hardware prototypes, applications, demos, systems, or simulations. We invite researchers from cross-domains (multi-disciplinary) to participate in this event to participate and become part of this CIE community by sharing examples of their work. Submissions are welcome across any application domain and any system that embodies the interplay across humans, computing devices, interaction technologies, and feedback mechanisms is welcome. Authors of papers submitted and/or accepted to any of the regular VES sessions are particularly welcome to submit their work to this event. The top two exhibits will be selected and honored at the conference. <br/>
			Here are the submission guidelines:<br/>
			•	A 3-page proposal (in the ASME IDETC format) detailing the following:<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	o	Aim of system being displayed <br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	o	Potential audience that will be interested in your exhibit.<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	o	Components of the system (with flowcharts etc., if applicable)<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	o	High quality images of the system in action.<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	o	Any specific requirements (power outlets, tables, etc.) for exhibiting the system.<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	o	If the system is based on a paper submitted to ASME IDETC/CIE, please refer to the paper as well.<br/>
			•	Poster describing the system, its motivation, and capabilities. 24” x 36” in size<br/>
			•	Demonstration at the event: We strongly encourage participants to demonstrate the actual system at the conference; However, a video of the system in action will be permitted in cases where it is difficult to transport the system components to the conference (e.g., systems involving moderate to large-scaled hardware systems).

            <h6>JCISE Spotlight Talks on Human-Robot Collaboration in Industry 5.0</h6>
			<p>
			Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is considered a pivotal element of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, wherein robots work alongside human partners to automate repetitive, physically demanding tasks and replace humans in hazardous or extreme working environments. Unfortunately, existing HRC methods mostly remain in laboratories and have not been extensively deployed in industries. They face challenges related to understanding, communication, and trust between humans and robots, effective interactions and interfaces, integration of robots with human cognition, task division, allocation, and optimization, as well as environmental sensing and perception and ensuring safety. This special session will invite papers accepted to the JCISE special issue on "Human-Robot Collaboration in Industry 5.0." This special issue of JCISE seeks to explore and compile the forefront of research and innovation in HRC within the context of Industry 5.0. We welcome contributions that present state-of-the-art methodologies, tools, systems, models, and case studies aimed at facilitating the advancement and realization of HRC in the foreseeable future.

            <h6>VES Panel: VES for Human-robot Collaboration – Understanding, Communication, and Trust between Humans and Robots</h6>
			<p>
			Modern manufacturing systems are expected to evolve into highly automated and intelligent systems for handling complex tasks. However, certain manual operations persist on the shop floor that are either impractical or unattainable without human involvement. Industry 5.0 has emerged as a practical approach that complements the existing Industry 4.0 paradigm by emphasizing the transition toward sustainable, human-centric, and resilient manufacturing. Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is considered pivotal in this transition, wherein robots collaborate with human partners to automate physically demanding tasks and integrate humans’ high-level cognition and decision-making. Unfortunately, current HRC methods have seen limited deployment in industries, facing challenges related to understanding, communication, building trust between humans and robots, effective interfaces, task division, allocation, and optimization. There are several specific research questions to ask: How should the interfaces and interactions be designed to support human operators in communicating with robots effectively, efficiently, and intuitively? How should trust between humans and robots be built and the safety of humans be ensured? How should human operators’ high-level decision-making ability be leveraged to improve the efficiency and flexibility of the HRC? How should Artificial Intelligence (AI) be designed to improve robots’ cognitive abilities so that they are able to understand human operators’ intentions and learn from human partners?
			</p><p>
			The objective of this panel is to bring together a group of experts in robotics, manufacturing, computer science, ergonomics and human factors, human-computer interaction, social sciences in engineering, and digital technologies for a cross-disciplinary discussion on the past, present, and future of Human-robot Collaboration in virtual environments, with an emphasis on understanding, communication, and trust. The panel discussion will explore: The panel discussion will explore: (1) where we stand in HRC research regarding understanding, communication, and trust between humans and robots; (2) what the challenges are and what the potential key enablers might be; (3) what intellectual challenges lie ahead; and (4) what steps we, as researchers, should take to investigate this exciting avenue.
