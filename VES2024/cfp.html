            <h2>USER EXPERIENCE (UX) DESIGN FOR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
			<p>The design of user experiences in virtual environments is inherently predicated upon a fundamental understanding of human perception, cognition, behavior, and action. Systematic investigation of new and existing user interactions, spatial technologies (cameras, controllers, haptics devices), visual representations of geometric and contextual information, and user preferences (such as gesture elicitation, micro-gestures) is critical in order to gain insights for virtual environment design. This symposium seeks contributions that aim to enrich user experience in virtual environments through the development and evaluation of (a) new ways to interact with virtual objects, (b) new ways of interaction with other people in virtual spaces, (c) new ways to represent visual as well as non-visual information in virtual environments, and (d) new insights on how users behave and perform in virtual environments. Research efforts on defining, measuring, and understanding user experience in virtual environments are also of interest. Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):<br/>
			•	Collaborative and multi-user virtual environments<br/>
			•	Integration of multi-touch and spatial user interfaces<br/>
			•	Mobile interactions and wearable technologies<br/>
			•	Speech-based interactions<br/>
			•	Visualization of geometric data (3D models, point-clouds, etc.)<br/>
			•	Visualization of non-geometric data (simulation results, scene summaries)<br/>
			•	Graphics, geometric modeling, and geometry processing for virtual environments<br/>
			•	Data collection, analysis, and studies of user actions and performance<br/>
			•	Haptics- and gaze-based interactions in VR/AR/MR<br/>
			•	Utilizing physiological sensors (EEG, ECG, etc.) in virtual environments
			</p>
			
			<h2>VIRTUAL SYSTEMS FOR ENGINEERING, HEALTHCARE, AND EDUCATION</h2>
			<p>User interfaces, interactions, and experiences are now pervasive in design, manufacturing, product inspection, customization, healthcare, education, technical training, and even daily consumer activities such as online purchases. The levels of user immersion possible within the reality-virtuality continuum can have profound effects on how designers design, engineers produce, and users use products. It has applications in healthcare, including pain management, physical therapy, and exposure therapy. It can also enhance education and training experiences. This is due to the unique affordances offered by the flexibility and intuitiveness of interaction with virtual objects and environments, the immersive experience and context-aware information visualization, perceptions about spatiality and dimensionality, and multi-modal (visual, auditory, and tangible) feedback. This symposium invites innovative research that incorporates technologies around virtual environments within concrete application contexts relevant to the domains of engineering, healthcare, and training. Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):<br/>
			•	Creativity-support for design and shape modeling<br/>
			•	Reverse engineering<br/>
			•	Immersive education and training with VR/AR/XR<br/>
			•	Healthcare applications in VE<br/>
			•	Designing VE for accessibility, disability, and wellbeing<br/>
			•	Speech-driven interfaces for design & manufacturing<br/>
			•	Virtual environments for decision making
			</p>
			
			<h2>AR/VR FOR MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS</h2>
			<p>With the rapid advancement of manufacturing towards higher efficiency and automation, humans in manufacturing require support to be better integrated with the manufacturing systems. On the other hand, the substantially increased complexity of manufacturing systems and associated software makes it difficult for humans to use them. Techniques are required to bridge humans and manufacturing systems to achieve more intelligence and flexibility in production, in addition to higher efficiency. The augmented/virtual reality techniques provide the new affordance to empower humans and manufacturing systems to better understand and communicate with each other. This symposium invites both fundamental research and novel applications for AR/VR techniques in manufacturing systems. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br/>
			•	Spatial reasoning, object recognition, and 3D tracking in the manufacturing systems<br/>
			•	Human-machine/robot collaboration<br/>
			•	AR/VR-assisted assembly, disassembly, diagnosis, and equipment maintenance<br/>
			•	AR/VR and digital twins <br/>
			•	Multi-user and distributed AR/VR systems in collaborative spaces<br/>
			•	Cyber physical system and Industry IoT with AR/VR<br/>
			•	Cybersecurity in AR/VR <br/>
			•	Competence, performance, and usability assessment of AR/VR systems <br/>
			•	Ergonomic analysis of AR/VR systems
			</p>
			
			<h2>VR/AR HARDWARE AND ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
			<p>Advancements in VR/AR hardware, such as headsets, haptic devices, and tracking systems, are ongoing research areas. Improving the quality, affordability, and comfort of these devices is a primary concern. In addition, ensuring that VR/AR experiences are accessible to individuals with disabilities is an important research area. This includes developing adaptive technologies and inclusive design practices. This symposium aims to explore the intersection of cutting-edge hardware developments and inclusive design principles to make VR/AR experiences accessible to a diverse range of users. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br/>
			•	Advancements in VR/AR Hardware<br/>
			•	Inclusive Design and User-Centered Approaches <br/>
			•	Haptic Feedback and Sensory Interfaces<br/>
			•	Case Studies and Real-World Applications<br/>
			•	Ethical Considerations and Data Privacy
			</p>
			
			<h2>INDUSTRIAL METAVERSE FOR SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS</h2>
			<p>In the era of Industry 4.0, the concept of the "Industrial Metaverse" has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm for redefining the landscape of supply chain and logistics. This symposium invites you to embark on a journey into the future of industry, where the boundaries between the physical and digital realms blur, offering unprecedented opportunities and challenges for businesses and professionals in the supply chain and logistics sectors. We aim to bring together researchers, industry experts, and innovators from across the globe to explore and dissect the multifaceted implications of the Industrial Metaverse on the supply chain and logistics domain. This symposium is designed to foster an environment of knowledge exchange, collaboration, and inspiration where participants will engage in insightful discussions, share groundbreaking research, and envision the possibilities that lie ahead. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br/>
			•	Fundamentals, core principles, and technologies of the Industrial Metaverse<br/>
			•	Digital twins and real-time data integration for smart supply chain and logistics<br/>
			•	AR/VR for immersive logistics, warehouse operations, and last-mile delivery <br/>
			•	Sustainability in the Metaverse for sustainable supply chain and logistics <br/>
			•	Competence, performance, and usability assessment of AR/VR systems <br/>
			•	Case Studies and success stories leveraging Industrial Metaverse
